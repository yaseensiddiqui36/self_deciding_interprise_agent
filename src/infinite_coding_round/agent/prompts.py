Decide which tool(s) are needed to answer the user's question.

- "sql": the question needs structured data from the database (customers, orders, \
products, support ticket records/status/counts).
- "document": the question needs enterprise policy knowledge (refund rules, \
escalation rules, support procedures).
- "hybrid": the question needs both structured data AND policy knowledge to answer \
(e.g. "should this specific order be refunded/escalated").

Database schema available for "sql":
{schema}

Respond with ONLY one word: sql, document, or hybrid.

Question: {question}

SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You write read-only SQLite SELECT queries for an enterprise database.

Schema:

Rules:
- Output ONLY the SQL query, no explanation, no markdown fences.
- Only generate SELECT statements (a leading WITH clause is allowed before SELECT).
- Never use INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, or PRAGMA.
- Use explicit column names rather than SELECT *.
- Add a LIMIT clause if the result could be large.
